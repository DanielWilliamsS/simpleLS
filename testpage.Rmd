```


This package allows least squares regression. The function `LS.model` fits the model to a given dataset `data`, with reference to the formula supplied as an input.

```{r}
LS.model = function(formula, data = NULL){

  ys = all.vars(formula)[1]
  y = data[,ys]
  X = model.matrix(formula, data)

  wLS =  solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y

  return(list(Parameters = wLS, df = X, y = y))
}
```

This returns the output from the least squares - the parameter estimates. Also included in the output is the model matrix $X$ and the response vector $y$.
